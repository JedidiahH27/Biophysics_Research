# Biophysics Research – Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs)
This repository contains materials related to my biophysics research on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), specifically those incorporating unnatural amino acids (UAAs) to enhance bacterial targeting while maintaining human cell safety. The work combines experimental techniques and structural analysis to explore AMP-membrane interactions and their implications for antibiotic resistance.

## 🧬 Abstract
This study investigates the potential of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as alternatives to combat antibiotic resistance, with a focus on two AMPs containing unnatural amino acids (UAAs), E2-53R (16 AAs) and LE-54R (14 AAs). In both peptides, valine is replaced by norvaline (Nva), and tryptophan is replaced by 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (Tic).

Microbiological studies reveal potent activity against both Gram-negative (G−) and Gram-positive (G+) bacteria without toxicity to eukaryotic cells. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy shows that both peptides maintain α-helical structures when interacting with G(−) and G(+) lipid model membranes (LMMs), a characteristic associated with their antimicrobial efficacy.

X-ray diffuse scattering (XDS) demonstrates membrane softening and reduced chain order in G(−), G(+), and eukaryotic (Euk33) LMMs, suggesting membrane destabilization as a potential mechanism. Furthermore, XDS identifies a significant correlation between peptide interfacial location and efficacy. Neutron reflectometry (NR) confirms the AMP locations determined via XDS. These UAAs-based AMPs offer a promising strategy to fight resistant bacteria while preserving host cell integrity. Comparisons are made with a previously studied natural peptide, E2-35, containing arginine, tryptophan, and valine.
